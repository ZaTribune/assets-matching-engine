## Design Overview
  <img src="docs/engine.svg" alt="logo">

- The `MatchingEngine` is the central componentâ€”consists of a set of `OrderBook`s.
- Each `OrderBook` is responsible for a specific asset's booking informationâ€”via `2` Queues.
  - One Queue for `BUY` orders.
  - Another for `SELL` orders.
- Queues are implemented with `PriorityBlockingQueue` as it's thread-safe FIFO data structure that can prioritize elements based on a custom `Comparator`.
- Each order placed is assigned an id from an `AtomicLong`â€”Another thread safe element used in applications such as atomically incremented sequence numbers.
  - `AtomicLong` is also managed by the `MatchingEngine`.
- The `Archive` is a centralized registry that tracks all orders submitted to the systemâ€”Also managed by the `MatchingEngine`.
- An `EventBus` is included to separate the logic of archiving from the typical booking process.
- In other words, all booking events are propagated from `OrderBook`s to the `MatchingEngine` via the `EventBus`.

### Built with
- Java (JDK 21).
- Spring Boot (3.4).

### Steps to deploy
- Load this project on Intellij.
- Run the application in `local` profile.
- Use [generated-requests.http](docs/generated-requests.http) to test the application.
